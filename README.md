Domain: Data Analytics / NLP
Project: Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

🎯 Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze and classify the sentiment of tweets into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

This helps in understanding public opinions, social media trends, and customer feedback for brands.

🧠 Key Steps
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters from tweets.
Text Normalization – Converted text to lowercase, removed stopwords, and applied stemming using PorterStemmer.
Feature Extraction (TF-IDF) – Converted clean text into numerical vectors using TfidfVectorizer.
Model Building – Trained a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict tweet sentiments.
Model Evaluation – Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
Visualization – Created plots for sentiment distribution and confusion matrix using Seaborn.
📊 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, Train-Test Split)
Google Colab
💡 Key Insights
No	Observation
1	Data cleaning improved text consistency and reduced noise.
2	TF-IDF effectively transformed text into numeric features.
3	Naive Bayes achieved ~85–90% accuracy.
4	Positive sentiments dominated the dataset.
5	Some overlap occurred between Neutral and Positive tweets.
📈 Results & Visualizations
✅ Accuracy: ~85–90% (depending on dataset)
📊 Sentiment Distribution: More Positive tweets observed
🔥 Confusion Matrix: Most predictions were accurate with few misclassifications
